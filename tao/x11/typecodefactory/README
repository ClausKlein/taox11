typecodefactory -------

This library is used by the CORBA::ORB to create typecodes.
To minimize dependencies and footprint, this library need not be
built or linked by an application. However, if an
application needs to call CORBA::ORB::create_*_tc(),
then it should #include the library's header file
typecodefactory.h and link the library.
This will automatically load the library, assuming
it has been compiled.


Since the TypeCodeFactory must deal with Interface
Repository data types, it depends on the
taox11_ifr_client library.
