This example shows how to use the TAOX11 logging framework

The TAOX11 logging framework provides a way to declare so
called user defined logging modules. Each module can have its
own settings to manipulate the logging output.

Please have a look at the ../../taox11/docs/x11_logging.html
document for a detailed explanation of the TAOX11 logging framework.
