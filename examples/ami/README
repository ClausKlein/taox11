A demo of the AMI callback model.

Description:

This is a simple demo of the AMI callback model implemented with TAOX11.
The client in this test invokes both asynchronous as synchronous calls.

Some more information about this example, can be found here:
$TAOX11_ROOT/docs/ami/index.html

How to run:

You can use the run_test.pl script to run it.

Notes:

 -For use of asynchronus invocations with TAOX11, you have to annotate
  this in the idl-file with #pragma corba_ami <interface> or with an
  annotation //@CORBA (ami=true) before the interface declaration .

 -Use the switch -GC on the ridl compiler to generate AMI support.

 -Make use of amic_traits
