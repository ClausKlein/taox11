This test is there to test the methods on the IORTable (bind/rebind/unbind). 
It'll also test whether the exceptions are thrown in a correct manner.

There are two servants created. The ior of the first is binded to "Hello"; the ior
of the second is rebinded to "Hello". Therefor the client should end up in the
second servant. This is tested.

The first ior is binded twice with the same name. This should throw an AlreadyBound
exception

Unbind will be invoked with a fake name and with "Hello". The first must throw a 
NotFound exception, the latter should succeed.
