This is a test for the of DynAny functionality.
To run a test, type

basic_test -t <dynany|dynarray|dynenum|dynsequence|dynstruct|dynunion|dynvalue>

To save on output, several things are tested in one pass. For each
pass, a message is displayed, for example:

"testing: constructor from any/insert/get"     or
"testing: constructor from typecode/from_any/to_any"

and finally an error count for the entire test.

Each DynAny is analyzed to make sure its contents is ok.
