Collocated exception test.

This test specifically tests exception which should be treated as 'collocated'.

The client invokes a method ('do_throw_struct') on object 'foo' in the server.
The server implements two interfaces:
one which the client uses ('foo') and one which the server itself uses ('bar').

'bar' contains one method and one attribute. The method raises an exception;
the getter and the setter of the attribute both raises exceptions as well. Since
this method and attribute are invoked from within the server, the invocations and
exceptions should be treated as 'collocated'.
