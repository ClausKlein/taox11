This test verifies that CodecFactory and CDR encapsulation Codec
support is working properly.

It does so by encoding a structure into an octet sequence, decoding
into a new instance of the structure from the octet sequence, and then
comparing the contents of the two structures. The encoded and decoded
structures are dumped to cout.

It also checks whether the following exceptions are thrown in predefined cases:

CodecFactory:
- create_codec
  - UnknownEncoding
- create_codec_with_codesets
  - UnknownEncoding
  - UnsupportedCodeset

Codec:
- encode
  - InvalidTypeForEncoding
- decode
  - FormatMismatch
- encode_value
  - InvalidTypeForEncoding
- decode_value
  - FormatMismatch
  - TypeMismatch


Run the test as follows:

$ perl run_test.pl
