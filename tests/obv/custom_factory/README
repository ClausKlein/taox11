@page obv/custom_factory Test README File

Because concrete valuetype classes are provided by the application
developer, valuetype-factories are needed for the creation of values.

According to spec however no factory base or concrete classes are
generated for value types lacking initializers but with operations
defined.
This is a very simple test to show how to create custom factory
classes for these value types.

To run the test either use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

        or start the client and the server manually:

$ server -o ior
$ client -k file://ior
