@page OBV/Factory Test README File

Because concrete valuetype classes are provided by the application
developer, valuetype-factories are needed for the creation of values.

This is a very simple test to show and verify basic OBV
factory construct functionality.

To run the test either use the run_test.pl script:

$ ./run_test.pl

        or start the client and the server manually:

$ server -o ior
$ client -k file://ior
