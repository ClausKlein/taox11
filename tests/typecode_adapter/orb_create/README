Normally, a typecode is created at compile time by the
IDL compiler for each declaration in an IDL file, or at
runtime by the  Interface Repository. However, in some
situations, such as a bridge between ORBs, a typecode may
have to be  created without any knowledge of the IDL and outside
any Interface Repository. In such cases, the typecode
creation methods of the pseudo-object CORBA::ORB are used.

This program is a simple example of the use of the
CORBA::ORB::create_*_tc methods.

These typecode creation methods make use of the functions
of the same name in typecodefactory. The taox11_typecodefactory
library is found in TAOX11_ROOT/tao/x11/typecodefactory, and
is used by CORBA::ORB::create_*_tc to create typecodes. This library
may be compiled, but, to keep dependencies and footprint
to a minimum, it is not linked and loaded automatically.
If an application makes use of one or more of the
CORBA::ORB typecode creation methods, the application must
contain the line

#include "<path>/"tao/x11/typecodefactory/typecodefactory.h"

and link the taox11_typecodefactory library. The #inlcude line
will automatically load the library for linking, if it has
been compiled.
