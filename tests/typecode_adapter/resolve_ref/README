Normally, a typecode is created at compile time by the
IDL compiler for each declaration in an IDL file, or at
runtime by the  Interface Repository. However, in some
situations, such as a bridge between ORBs, a typecode may
have to be  created without any knowledge of the IDL and outside
any Interface Repository. In such cases, the typecode
creation methods of the pseudo-object CORBA::ORB are used.

This program is a simple example of the use of the
TypeCodeFactory create_*_tc methods.
The TypeCodeFactory reference is retrieved from the orb.
