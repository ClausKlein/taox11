= The TAOX11 RIDL Compiler

The TAOX11 package contains its own developed IDL compiler. This IDL
compiler is written in the https://www.ruby-lang.org[Ruby] programming
language and uses the Open Source
https://www.remedy.nl/opensource/ridl.html[RIDL] compiler
framework developed by Remedy IT.
RIDL supports the implementation of different pluggable code generator
backends for various IDL language mappings using a single frontend. The
TAOX11 IDL compiler implements such a pluggable code generator backend
for the IDL to {cxx11} language mapping.

== Scope

This document describes the options and features of the RIDL compiler.
It is not a reference manual or tutorial on OMG IDL. For more
information on OMG IDL see the
https://www.omg.org/spec/IDL/3.5[IDL 3.5 specification],
the https://www.omg.org/spec/CORBA[CORBA specification], and the
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201379279/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0201379279&linkCode=as2&tag=theaceorb-20[Advanced
CORBA Programming with C++] book.

All https://www.omg.org/spec/IDL/4.2[IDL4] support is experimental.
The IDL to {cxx11} language defines a mapping for the IDL4 extended datatypes, but
there is only for DDS a standardized wire protocol for transferring these types through the wire.
For CORBA this is standardized yet and need still a lot of
research and standardization work.

== Usage

The basic command line for the RIDL compiler is:

-------------------------------------------
ridlc [options] [<idlfile> [<idlfile> ...]]
-------------------------------------------

Use the following command to get information on the various command line
options also shown below:

--------
ridlc -h

Defines a preprocessor macro. By default the following macros are
defined: +

`{cxx11}`
* `\\__RIDLBE_VER__` set to the stringified version of the active (main)
RIDL backend
* `\\__RIDL_IDL_VERSION__` set to the stringified version of the IDL
version (3 or 4)|
